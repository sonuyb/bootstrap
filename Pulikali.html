                <h1><u>Pulikali</u></h1>
                <p>
                    The history of Puli Kali can be traced back to the times of King Maharaja Rama Varma, the Maharaja of Cochin 200 years ago. He encouraged this grand celebration of Onam. Since then people started performing this peculiar art form on such a massive scale.It is performed around Onam, the harvest festival of Kerala. The harvest season in Kerala lasts between late August to early September. It is said that Vaman, one of the incarnations of Lord Vishnu descended on Earth to destroy an evil King(asura) named King Mahabali. 
                    Mahabali was very powerful and his kingdom encompassed the three worlds as described in Hindu mythology. Vaman, who was a Brahmin kid, appeared to King Mahabali and asked for as much land as extended over his three steps. 
                    The kid started growing bigger and bigger. In his first step, he covered the sky and the earth in his second step. Mahabali had realised that he is Lord Vishnu. When the kid asked the king where he should put his third step, the king, not wanting to insult the lord, answered that he can step on his head. 
                    Impressed by his politeness and reverence, Vaman gifted him with a boon that the king will get to see his subjects once in a year. As soon as Vaman stepped onto his head, Mahabali happened to attain salvation and enjoyed his boon to see his subjects annually during the harvest festival of Onam.
