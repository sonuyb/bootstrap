                    yakshagana, dance-drama of South India, associated most strongly with the state of Karnataka. Elaborate and colourful costumes, makeup, and masks constitute some of the most-striking features of the art form. Traditionally, yakshagana was performed in the open air by all-male troupes sponsored by various Hindu temples. Since the mid-20th century, however, many performances have been held on indoor stages, and women began to train in the tradition in the 1970s With roots in Sanskrit literature and theatre, yakshagana emerged as a form of dance-drama in the 16th century. During the following 500 years, the yakshagana corpus grew to include hundreds of plays, most written in Telugu or in the Kannada language, but only about five dozen of the works were actively performed in the 21st century. The narratives are drawn primarily from the great Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata as well as from the tales of the youthful god Krishna as recounted in the Bhagavata-purana. Historically, the cities of Tanjore (now Thanjavur) and Madura (now Madurai), both in the state of Tamil Nadu, and Mysore, in Karnataka, were centres of yakshagana composition. Among the most-notable texts are the Telugu Sugriva vijayam (“Sugriva’s Victory”; c. 1570) by Kandukur Rudra Kavi and the Kannada works of Parti Subba (fl. c. 1800), who is known for his moving episodes and songs from the Ramayana.
